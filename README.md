# Figma-to-html: a single page with the fixed width

A single page design implemented in pure HTML and CSS with the use of flexbox and CSS grid.

This is the result of following a short yet detailed course by [Kezz Bracey](https://github.com/kezzbracey) published on [Envato Tuts+](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/figma-to-html-code-up-a-single-page-design).

The original design available here: [Knife Travel Web Design Template](https://elements.envato.com/knife-travel-travel-agency-web-design-template-7JC2PP)
